# Famous Dave's BBQ Menu with React, TailwindCSS, and Three.js

This project showcases an interactive menu for Famous Dave's, featuring a unique BBQ smoke effect using Three.js, styled with TailwindCSS, and built with React.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies
4. Start the development server
Your application should now be running on `http://localhost`.

## Features

- **React**: Efficient, declarative, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Three.js**: Create and render the BBQ smoke effect to bring the menu to life with 3D graphics.

## Creating the BBQ Smoke Effect

The BBQ smoke effect is implemented using Three.js. We create a 3D scene, add smoke textures, and use particle systems to simulate smoke. This effect is added to the background of the menu for an immersive user experience.

For detailed instructions on implementing the smoke effect, refer to the `SmokeEffect.js` file in the `src/components` directory.
